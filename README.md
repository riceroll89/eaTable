## Description
eaTable is a restaurant table reservation web application which provides general users the ability to order their meal in advance. This was a student project for CSC648: Software Engineering at San Francisco State University with a development time frame of 3 months. Languages used included HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and PHP on an Amazon Web Services server with a MySQL database. We used a roll-your-own model-view-controller architecture as we were not permitted by the instructor to use a pre-built framework. Collaboration and version control were achieved via Subversion VCS.

This link points to our application as of the end of the semester, prior to our final class presentation, stored on the class Amazon Web Server. *It is available purely for demonstration purposes and is not a real service*: http://sfsuswe.com/~f15g04/
